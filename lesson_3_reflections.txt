When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may be working on a file and do not want changes happening while
    you are working on the file.
