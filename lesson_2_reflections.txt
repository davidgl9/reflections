What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 

    It creates a start point for version control. It is needed to track versions    of files tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging are are some or all the files in the working directory that
    are "staged" to go into the repository.  It gives you a chance to review
    the files that are going to be committed.
